## CodeConvention

## WHY ? ? 
When software engineers/developers love writing code, they will really hate you when you tell write code like this, make function names like that, don't use pointer there and so on. But this kind of conventions are very important for companies and modern software development. 

For example, some people like functions names with positive logic( isBroadcastPacket() ) and some others like negative logic( isNotBroadcastPacket() ). If you don't decide posive or negative logic for your framework/API/product, people maybe get confused and your software product will be fail at some point.

As a conclusion , if you are software developer and you writes discordant code then don't give a sh*t about the software convention, so you are far away from modern software engineering/development.


## INFO
This documents will describe how to write C/C++, Java codes when you are part of software development team. You don't need to be or must follow this structre, you can declare your convention. Docs will be available ASAP!
